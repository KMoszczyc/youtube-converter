## Deployment
You need to host this repo (local branch for local, master for cyclic.sh) and https://github.com/KMoszczyc/yt-dlp-back for fast youtube download. Ytdl-core is now very slow when it comes to downloading (at least at the time of fixing this bug) compared to yt-dlp and
yt-dlp doesn't have a npm package, only a python one. That's why a second repo was necessary for this app to work.
So firstly:
- Deploy https://github.com/KMoszczyc/yt-dlp-back on Heroku, Render or locally
- Change necessary endpoints in this repo (https://github.com/KMoszczyc/youtube-converter) - (script.js and in utils.js)
- Change BUCKET_NAME in utils.js (optional - if using cyclic.sh)
- Deploy this repo (I recommend cyclic.sh)
- Enjoy!
