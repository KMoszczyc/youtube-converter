# youtube-converter
YouTube mp3 converter with frontend in Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML and backend in Node.js and Express.js.

## Usage ðŸ“„
Go to
ðŸ’» https://youtube-converter.adaptable.app/

- Paste youtube link of desired song to the text area  
- Choose bitrate
- Click 'Convert' and wait for download button to pop up  
- Click 'Download'  
- Enjoy!
- (Sometimes the first conversion loads indefinetly, depending on where you host yt-dlp. If that happens just reload the page and try again.)

## Features ðŸŽ‰
- YouTube video to mp3 conversion
- Chooseable bitrate 64-320 kbps
- Adds thumbnail, artist and song title to mp3 meta-tags 
- Fully responsive UI
- Supports multiple requests simultaneously

## Deployment
You need to host this repo and https://github.com/KMoszczyc/yt-dlp-back for fast youtube download. Ytdl-core is now very slow when it comes to downloading (at least at the time of fixing this bug) compared to yt-dlp and
yt-dlp doesn't have a npm package, only a python one. That's why a second repo was necessary for this app to work.
So firstly:
- Deploy https://github.com/KMoszczyc/yt-dlp-back on Heroku, Render, Adaptable.io or locally
- Change necessary endpoints in this repo (https://github.com/KMoszczyc/youtube-converter) - (script.js and in utils.js)
- Change BUCKET_NAME in utils.js (optional - if using cyclic.sh)
- Deploy this repo (I recommend adaptable.io)
- Enjoy!
